# CampgroundsWebApp
This project is a web app that takes in campground reviews the user must create a account or log in to add a review. This process is check with passport and passport-local the user is authenticated to see if the campground is his/hers, we implemented this by adding in the id to the path if the id matches the user can than delete the review if they choose too. The username after registered is stored in our mysql database which is ran on rds mysql on aws. Only a user that is logged in or registered can create a new review and only the user who created that specific review can delete the review. What makes this project different than other campground review sites is we implemented a animal siting button. After the user is logged in, he can goto the campground review and if they see an animal at that location they can click the add alert button and comment what animal siting they wish to add. Whether itâ€™s a deer to so other family members or inform other campers of dangerous animals at the campground. We added a confirm siting button to confirm the siting, the more confirms the more reliable the siting is. The confirm siting value is stored in our database and increments as the button is click.
